# STM32surface
This is a Bluepill-compatible devboard for the STM32F411CEU6 microcontroller.
It uses 0805 surface mount parts and a few through hole parts that can be easily obtained as
generic components.  It is intended to be an alternative should the 
should the STM32F411CE6 Bluepill not be available.
The layout is somewhat optimized to be RFI resistant given it is a two-layer board
